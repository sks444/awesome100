# awesome100

A curated awesome 100 list in any field.

## The Goal

This project is about collecting the best 100 profiles in any field or area. 
The Goal is to make an API with the collected data, and then we can also show a cool frontend page by making use of the API, which can be helpful for us in many ways. E.g: Every time we choose a area of work, first we search for the best profile or the best thing happend in that area till date. One can also make use of the API for their personal stuffs or websites.

## Deployment

The plan is to deploy the project with [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/])
